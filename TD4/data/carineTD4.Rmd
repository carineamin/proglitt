```{r}
tab <- read.csv("Nile.csv")
```

```{r}
ggplot(data=tab, aes(x=time, y=Nile)) + geom_point()  + xlab("Time (year)") +ylab("Nile") + ylim(0,NA) + geom_smooth()
```

As we can see in the graph, we have the volume of the Nile that varies between the years 1871 and 1970.

We can realize that in 1879, the volume of the Nile was at its highest point which is 1370 and in 1913 , the volume was at its lowest point which is less than 500.

We can also notice thanks to the function "geom_smooth()" that the volume decreases by time.
